# word_cloud
A basic python app that takes a text file and returns a dictionary of the 10 most common words (sans stopwords)

Requirements:
Python 3

Run from the command line as the following:

python3 word_cloud.py <name of file you want to process> <name of stopwords file>

I've included a list of common stopwords. Feel free to alter this list, but keep the current format (each new stopword on a new line).

For what it's worth, Python's NLTK library includes a list of stopwords. I may add this functionality in later, and give the user the option of adding more stopwords.
